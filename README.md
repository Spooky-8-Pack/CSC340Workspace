## Description
> Our app will be a clothing shop. Customers will be able to view available clothes, add to their cart and favorites list, checkout items within their cart, and write reviews on shops. Providers will be able to list clothing for sale, view statisitics on active and past orders, and reply to customer reviews.
> The goals for this app are to provide a place for students on campus to buy and sell clothing between each other. This app will provide a community for students to expand their wardrobe and get rid of clothing they don't want around anymore.
